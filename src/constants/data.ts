## Introduction

The landscape of web development has evolved dramatically over the past decade. What started as simple HTML pages with basic JavaScript has transformed into complex, highly interactive applications that rival native desktop software. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the modern web development stack, focusing on React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

> "The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect — to help people work together — and not as a technical toy." — Tim Berners-Lee

### Why This Stack?

- **React**: Component-based architecture for building reusable UI elements
- **Next.js**: Framework for production-ready React applications with SSR/SSG
- **TypeScript**: Type safety that catches errors before runtime
